### Numerical Practice Problems

# Write a method `primes(num)` returns an array of the first `num` primes
def primes(count)
end

# Write a method that returns the factors of a number in ascending order.
def factors(num)
end

# Write a method, `digital_root(num)`. It should Sum the digits of a positive
# integer. If it is greater than 10, sum the digits of the resulting number.
# Keep repeating until there is only one digit in the result, called the
# "digital root". **Do not use string conversion within your method.**
def digital_root(num)
end

# Recursively calculate the sum of an array of values
def sum_rec(nums)
end

# Write a **recursive** implementation of a method that returns the
# first `n` factorial numbers.
# n_factorials(6) == [0!, 1!, 2!, 3!, 4!, 5!]
def factorials_rec(num)
end
